# texstyle

My collection of LaTeX styles. You can use them, you can even adapt them
(see license).

## Available styles

### simple-assigment

Simple style for assignments with problem and subproblem environments.
Also contains some usable packages (some of them well suited for formal
languages related topics).

## License

The license is [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) unless stated otherwise
in the style.

That means you can use, share, redistribute and change those styles provided
you state the authors as provided by the style itself. You do not have
to include this attribution in the resulting document (for example
PDF), keeping it in the source is sufficient.

## Development info

Feel free to make a fork and pull request. But hold with following rules:

*   Please keep commits to different directories separated and prefix
    them with directory name.
*   Please separate example changes from style changes.
*   If you make nontrivial change state you can state it in the header
    together with your name.
